# Chess
Classical Chess Game from scratch written in python.
By The Chambiant Penguins

## Description
We are building a chess game in the most efficient way possible. We need to write every rule in chess,
which is easier said than done, and then make the I/O (user interaction). We plan to buid an intuitive GUI
and 2 or 1 player modes (person vs person or person vs a really dumb bot).
