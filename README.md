# Chess
Classical Chess Game from scratch written in python.
By The Chambiant Penguins

## Description
We are building a chess game in the most efficient way possible. We need to write every rule in chess,
which is easier said than done, and then make the I/O (user interaction). We plan to buid an intuitive GUI
and 2 or 1 player modes (person vs person or person vs a really dumb bot).

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
